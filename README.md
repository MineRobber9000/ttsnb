# Things That Should Not Be

This repository is a collection of things that simply should not be. You can write anything, code, literature, whatever, and submit it here.

Got a monster Python oneliner with lambdas and AST fuckery galore? Put it here!

Got terrible, just absolutely terrible Bendy/Bendy (Ink Machine/Fosters) fanfiction that you want to share? I wouldn't want to touch it with a 10 foot pole but I will *gladly* take it here!

Nothing is off the table except for obvious spam PRs (and PRs that mess with something someone else wrote/did. Make your own nightmare fuel!).

I don't want to touch it. You probably don't want to touch it. The creator doesn't want to touch it. So do whatever and enjoy the nightmares!

In technical terms, all of the code and literature in this repository is CC0. No need to credit us; in fact, we'd probably prefer if you *didn't* credit us.
